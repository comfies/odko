                     a minimal graphical programming language.

[ DESCRIPTION ]

the main purpose is to make it look cool and make working in it cool enough just
because  you  want  to  feel like a cool hacker, functionality is the last of my
concerns  and  the  language  is  being  designed as i'm going through it but it
doesn't matter as long as it's cool.

[ LANGUAGE DESIGN ]

> everything is vague right now, but this gives a broad outline of what i'm
  trying to accomplish and will aid in development

you have blocks in rows in columns, you then connect the blocks mostly linearly
and the program is executed in parallel in that order.

each  block  contains  a  command  and  arguments for it, it then passes what it
returns down to the connected block(s).
