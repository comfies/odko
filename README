[ DESCRIPTION ]

the main purpose is to make it look cool and make working in it cool enough just
because  you  want  to  feel like a cool hacker, functionality is the last of my
concerns  and  the  language  is  being  designed as i'm going through it but it
doesn't matter as long as it's cool.

[ LANGUAGE DESIGN ]

> everything is vague right now, but this gives a broad outline of what i'm
  trying to accomplish and will aid in development

you  have blocks as rows in columns, you then connect the blocks mostly linearly
and the program is executed in parallel in that order.

each block contains a single value or command and arguments for it, it then passes what it
returns  down  to the connected block(s). because odko is event-driven each line
should start with an event command,  and then when that event occurs the program
branches out from that first block by activating the connected blocks.

[ SYNTAX AND EXAMPLES ]

- FizzBuzz @ code/fizzBuzz.json & fizzBuzz.png
- hi-lo    @ code/hi-lo.json    & hi-lo.png

to  load  .json files open the dev console and write `load([contents of json])`.
preferably you would copy and paste the contents of the json file. to save your
own examples run `save()` and copy the JSON string it outputs.

yes, there will be a cleaner way of importing and exporting code and, yes, i am
planning on coming up with a way to write plaintext odko code, and it may be
presented with a tui version of odko as well.

[ VALUES ]

values take the forms of numbers, strings, and specials.

number values (specifically integers) can simply typed into a block. they are
also used as booleans in the forms of 1s and 0s.

strings are marked with a concatenator followed by a raw string (optional),  you
are also able to forgo concatenation  completely and just return a raw string if
need be. concatenators work by taking the connected blocks to the current block,
and then concatenating them with a space (or not, depends on the concatenator).

  [ "###### ]
   concatenate top-to-bottom and append a raw string
  [ '###### ]
   concatenate bottom-to-top and prepend a raw string
  [ .###### ]
   simply return a raw string

special values are usually placeholder values to make code neater, like;

  [ nil ]
   placeholder value, returns "nil". evaluated to 0 by arithmetic commands and
   to an empty string when string values try to concatenate it.
  [ true, tru ]
   placeholder value, returns 1.
  [ false, fal ]
   placeholder value, returns 0.
  [ unknown, error, bad ]
   placeholder value, returns -1.

[ COMMANDS ]

> if a command has a simple non-fatal error, they just return -1, else they halt
  the execution of the program and write the error in the console.
> arithmetic commands error if no arguments are provided.

  [ + A B C ]
   add A B C together, B or C can be omitted. returns the sum.
  [ - A B C ]
   subtract B from A and C from that, B or C can be omitted. returns the result.
  [ * A B C ]
   multiply A B C together, B or C and be omitted. returns product.
  [ / A B C ]
   divide A by B and that by C, B or C can be omitted. returns the result.
  [ % A B   ]
   modulo operation, returns the remainder of A / B. errors if not enough args.
  [ len ### ]
   returns length of arguments concatenated with a space, if no args then 0.
  [ rand MX ]  rand 10,  rnd 100,  rng 999
   returns random number between 0 and M(a)X, by default MX is 1. valid aliases
   for this command are rnd and rng.

  [ log ### ]   log _,  log A B
   concatenates arguments (with space, " ") and prints them to console. can omit
   space when using the ! alias in the form [ !###### ]
  [ clear   ]   clear,  cls
   clears the console, also available under the alias cls.

  [ jmp X Y ]   jmp 0 0,   jmp
   adds location to jump to after current  branch finishes executing into queue,
   this allows you to create loops in conjunction with the conditional if. X and
   Y have to both be present and integers.

  [ ?A ## B ]   ?A == B,  ?A > B
   conditional if statement, it compares two A with B,  if the statement is true
   it  activates the first connected block,  else the second, and if there is an
   error then the third one will activate. you do not need to provide all three
   connections,  just one or even none won't error. the spaces around the ## can
   be omitted to compare registers and the such.  ## can be one of the following
   operations/comparators:
    [ == ] A is equal B                 [ != ] A is not equal to B
    [ >  ] A is greater/longer than B   [ <  ] A is smaller/shorter then B
    [ >= ] A is >, or equal to B        [ <= ] A is <, or equal to B
    [ && ] A and B are greater then 0   [ || ] A or B are greater then 0
    [ ^^ ] A or B is greater/longer than 0, but not both A and B (XOR)

  [ ?A #### ]   ?A NaN,  ?A !NaN
   conditional if statement variation with only one input. works like expected.
    [  NaN ] A is not a number          [ !NaN ] A is (not not) a number

[ EVENTS ]

> during testing, events will always return a -1 (error value)

most  events  have argument locations,  which are places the interpreter expects
you to have entered an argument.  the # argument(s)  are required,  and capitals
(when stated as having such meaning) are optional arguments.

sometimes optional arguments take the form of 'switches',  basically a 0 or 1 or
more value (depending on function, 0 or 1 if not stated otherwise) which enables
or disables something to make the event more specific/etc. you get it hopefully.

events return their position in the starting column unless specified  otherwise,
if multiple values are returned then they will be stated.

  [ onRun   ]
   blocks connected to this block will run as soon as possible after the program
   has begun execution. it returns its Y position.

  [ k_# ABC ]
   blocks  connected  to this block will run after the key # has been depressed.
   if # is set to an asterisk (*) then any key will call this event. A, B, and C
   are switches which enable or disable the requirement of the Shift,  Ctrl,  or
   Alt modifiers modifier keys respectively. the switches can also be omitted or
   replaced with a question mark (?)  (eg. if you need the Shift and Alt keys to
   be held,  but don't care about the state of the Ctrl key,  your ABC arguments
   would be set to "1?1"). it returns the key which was pressed.

  [ k-# ABC ]
   same as previous except fires after the key # has been released.

  [ c##_ABC ]
   same as the  [ k_# ]  event except instead of a character you would input two
   hexadecimal digits that represent a javascript keycode.  you also cannot pass
   in two asterisks in place of the ##.

  [ c##-ABC ]
   same as the  [ k-# ]  event except instead of a character you would input two
   hexadecimal digits that represent a javascript keycode.

  [ m_# ABC ]
   same as the [ k_# ] event except executed on mouse button # depressing. # can
   be 0 for left click, 1 for middle click, 2 for right click. (etc?)  when this
   event is  triggered it returns  multiple values,   value X for the horizontal
   cell clicked, Y for the vertical cell clicked,  M for the raw x position, and
   N for the raw y position. it returns the mouse button pressed for blocks that
   are connected directly.

  [ m-# ABC ]
   same as previous except fires after the mouse button # has been released.

[ REGISTERS ]

> excluding the v argument  results in a  fatal error for all assignments except
  for set (=), append ("=), and prepend ('=)

registers are odko's form of variables,  they are referred to with two capitals.
they are always stored as strings but converted to integers when required.

these all return the new value of the register.

  [ ## = v  ]
   sets register ## to v,  if no v provided then clears the register and returns
   a nil value.
  [ ## "= v ]
   appends the string v to register ##.
  [ ## '= v ]
   prepends the string v to register ##.
  [ ## += v ]
   appends v to register ##, if register and v are integers then adds.
  [ ## -= v ]
   subtracts v from register ##, if either are not integers then errors
  [ ## *= v ]
   v has to be an integer else errors. if register is integer then multiply else
   repeat string v times.
  [ ## /= v ]
   divides register ## by v, if either are not integers then returns errors
  [ ## %= v ]
   gets the  remainder of  register ##  divided by v,  if either aren't integers
   then errors

[ KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS ]

> ^ is short for  "ctrl + ..."  and  capital  letters imply shift being pressed,
  slashes  delimitate  aliases  of  a  certain  function, and 'special keys' are
  written out  with  Title Case.   in the case of special keys requiring a shift
  modifier then the shortcuts will be written out literally as "Shift + ..."
> we  call  them keyboard shortcuts but there's no mouse control implemented yet
  so they are really the only kind of control you have right now
