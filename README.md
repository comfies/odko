A minimal graphical programming language.

The main purpose is to make it look cool and make working in it cool enough just because you want to feel like a cool hacker, functionality is the last of my concerns and the language is being designed as I'm going through it but it doesn't matter as long as it's cool.

## Language Design
> everything is vague right now, but this gives a broad outline of what I'm trying to accomplish and will aid in development

You have blocks in rows in columns, you then connect the blocks mostly linearly and the program is executed in parallel in that order.

Each block contains a command and arguments for it, it then passes what it returns down to the connected block.
